# Forecast Sales

Sales forecasts have traditionally been computed on time series data using regression models, such as linear regression models, with the limitation of only the time-series data as an input. The solution we propose is to utilize a Multi-layer Perceptron neural network to apply a supervised learning approach to forecast monthly sales using more features than just the time-series of sales. We will be using the date for the item-store sale data, monthly mean for the price of the item at each store, monthly total sales for that item for each store, previous monthâ€™s total sales for that item at that store, and a TfidfVectorizer of the item categories as input features to the Multi-layer Perceptron. We expect the ability of the Multi-layer Perceptron to utilize more features than just periodic sales to lead to a higher RMSE score than a simple linear regression.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

- Install Python 3.6 environment with needed packages listed in Prerequistes

## Running the Forecast

- Save sales data as "sales_train.csv" in "data" folder
- Run "sales-forecast-final.ipynb" using "test.csv" stored in "data" folder
- Forecasts for next month's total sales for each store-item combination outputted as "forecast.csv"
